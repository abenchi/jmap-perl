<h1>Good work, your JMAP proxy account is now set up</h1>

<p>$INFO - (<a href="/">back to main page</a>)</p>

<p>To access the account, POST with the JMAP protocol to <a href="https://proxy.jmap.io/jmap/$UUID/">https://proxy.jmap.io/jmap/$UUID/</a> - there is no need to use any other form of authentication, the UUID is used by itself for privacy. Yes, we know this isn't enough security for a public service (and we need to implement the JMAP auth spec!), but it will do for testing.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://proxy.jmap.io/client/?debug=1&amp;k=$UUID">FastMail web client example</a>. Please bookmark this launch page first, as the client link may change. You can always get to it via here!</p>

<p>Please note: it may take a few minutes before the API responds to requests, because it needs to do an initial sync of all mailbox envelope data.</p>

<p>If you need to reset your account or want to delete all your data, please go to <a href="https://proxy.jmap.io/delete/$UUID">https://proxy.jmap.io/delete/$UUID</a>.  It will redirect you to the homepage when the account is wiped.</p>
